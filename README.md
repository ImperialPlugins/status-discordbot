# ImperialPlugins Status Discord Bot

A bot that automatically grabs a screenshot from [https://status.imperialplugins.com](https://status.imperialplugins.com) with Pupeteer and posts it to Discord.  
Note: you need to create a config.json and set the DISCORD_TOKEN env variable. If not using docker, you also need to set CHROME_PATH.
